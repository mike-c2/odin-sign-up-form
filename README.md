# The Odin Sign-up Form Page

This was done as an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

This is a page with basic form functionality implemented. Part of the page also includes a background and logo.

The page can be seen [here](https://mike-c2.github.io/odin-sign-up-form).

Note: The buttons and links do not point to any real URLs, so will result in a 404 error.
